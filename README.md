# Solidity Exercises

This repo contains ordered Solidity smart contract exercises aimed at teaching beginners by providing a hands-on learning path from easier to harder concepts. The goal is to learn Solidity incrementally through practical coding exercises.

## Completed Exercises

1. Simple Storage Contract

    - Write a simple Solidity smart contract that stores a number and has functions to get and set the number.

    - Contract code: [SimpleSmartContract.sol](SimpleSmartContract/SimpleSmartContract.sol)

    - Details: This contract contains a private `uint` variable to store a number. A constructor sets the initial value. Getter and setter functions allow reading and writing the value. The getter is declared as a `view` function.

## Running Exercises Locally

To compile and run contracts locally:

1. Install dependencies 

2. Compile contracts

3. Deploy to local blockchain  

4. Interact via console
